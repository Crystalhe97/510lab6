LLM and Chat Bots

## What I have Learned From This Lab

- I learned how to create AI-powered assistants that can interact with users, process uploaded files, and provide customized feedback or responses. This involves understanding how to integrate AI APIs with web applications. 
- I learned using a .env file for storing API keys, students will understand the importance of keeping sensitive information secure and out of the source code. This teaches best practices for security and configuration management in software projects.

## Questions / Uncertainties
- How do I handle different file types (e.g., PDF, DOCX) for data extraction?
- What libraries or tools can I use to extract text from uploaded files efficiently?
